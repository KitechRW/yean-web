  text: `The AIIC is an agribusiness incubation center powered by
    YEAN. Agribusiness is one of the priorities for the
    country for job and wealth creation. Through our work,
    YEAN has realized that agripreneurs face multiple
    challenges including the lack of adequate skills,
    mentorships and coaching to innovate, develop and scale up
    their ideas. YEAN in collaboration with the University of
    Lay Adventist of Kigali (UNILAK) through the support of
    the Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA)
    together with the Association for Strengthening
    Agricultural Research in Eastern and Central Africa
    (ASARECA) and the East African Farmersâ€™ Federation (EAFF)
    supported by the Organization of African, Caribbean, and
    Pacific States (OACPS) through the ACP Innovation Fund
    which is funded by the European Union (EU), has
    established a space for agripreneurs. The space was
    established to strengthen the agribusiness ecosystem in
    Rwanda. The center provides incubation and business
    support services to agripreneurs through availing
    infrastructures, providing training programs and workshop
    to incubates, technical and business mentorship,
    Networking and access to finance. If you are considering
    venturing in agribusiness (Crop and livestock Primary
    Production, Processing, post-harvest handling, marketing)
    this center is for you. Join and be part of agribusiness
    professional community.`,
