  About us`,
  history: `<p class="text-sm text-gray-800 mt-6 w-full text-justify md:max-w-4xl">
  YEAN was established in 2014 with the main aim of connecting
  farmers to useful information in their farming activities.
  Using technology facilities, YEAN connected the youth to
  unlock their potential in transforming Agriculture into a
  sustainable source of income and job creation in Rwanda.
  Farmers were lacking access to most valuable information in
  their daily life. YEAN created platforms of farmers, which
  allow them to have information at the right time. We believe
  that the transfer of technology and skills from content
  owners and researchers to farmers is a key solution to the
  skills gaps we have in accessing what’s needed to be a
  professional farmer.
</p>
<p class="text-sm text-gray-800 mt-2 w-full text-justify md:max-w-4xl">
  Since its creation, YEAN have inspired hundreds of youth to
  start professional farming activities and have significantly
  contributed to farming technology upgrade among farmers.
  YEAN have been creating contents for its agriculture
  extension services and has acquired extensive experience in
  what information needed, where it is needed and how to
  transfer it to be adopted by farmers. YEAN have implemented
  a number of research and extension projects in collaboration
  with individual farmers, farmers’ organizations and
  development organizations in both animal and crop
  production. This journey has shaped our understanding of
  extension and advisory sector and have contributed to our
  goal of creating jobs to young professionals in agriculture
  to contribute to agriculture transformation
</p>`,
  vision: `Transforming traditional subsistence agriculture into
agribusiness through youth innovations as skilled and
powerful weapon for leading the change toward sustainable
livelihood.`,
  mission: `Spread agriculture information and facts to the community
  to inspire change for the pursuit of beauty and excellence
  in young agripreneurs and the community.`,
